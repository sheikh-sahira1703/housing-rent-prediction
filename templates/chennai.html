        <p>
            In this image, we have analyzed 4 things, the distribution of rent in Chennai, distribution of the area of
            houses in Chennai,
            Number of bedrooms in the houses in Chennai and distribution of bathrooms in the houses in Chennai.
            From this figure, we find that the rent of most houses is under 40k rupees, most of the houses in Chennai
            are under 4000 square
            feet in area, most houses in Chennai have 1 or 2 bedrooms and 1 or 2 bathrooms

        <p>
            This image shows the most spacious and least spacious localities to live in Chennai. Spaciousness of a
            locality is calculated by
            taking the average of areas of houses in that locality. Most spacious localities are the localities that
            have the highest average area
            of all the houses in that locality and converse is true for the least spacious localities. From this image,
            we see that Sekkadu, Vasantham Nagar and Annai Meenakshi Nagar are the least spacous localities in Chennai whereas 
            Uthandi, Pallavan Nagar Main Road and Kutthambakkam are the most spacious localities in Chennai

        <img class="LeftAlign" src="static/Affordability/CHENNAI.png" alt="Aahemdabad-affordability" border="0">
        <p>
            This image shows the most afforable and least afforable localities to live in Chennai. Affordability
            of a locality is calculated by
            taking the average price of all the houses in that locality. Most affordable localities are the
            localities that have the lowest average
            price and the converse is true for least afforable localities. From this image, we see that
            Vasantham Nagar, Sekkadu and Manimangalam are the most afforable localities in Chennai whereas 
            Akkarai, Thousand Lights, and Nadhampakkam are the least affordable localities in Chennai
