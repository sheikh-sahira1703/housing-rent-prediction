    <img class="LeftAlign" src="static/Numerical/HYDERABAD.png" alt="Hyderabad-numerical" border="0">
    <p>
      In this image, we have analyzed 4 things, the distribution of rent in Hyderabad, distribution of the area of
      houses in Hyderabad,
      Number of bedrooms in the houses in Hyderabad and distribution of bathrooms in the houses in Hyderabad.
      From this figure, we find that the rent of most houses is under 40k rupees, most of the houses in Hyderabad
      are under 4000 square
      feet in area, most houses in Hyderabad have 1 or 2 bedrooms and 1 or 2 bathrooms

    <h3>Area</h3>
    <img class="RightAlign" src="static/Spacious/HYDERABAD.png" alt="Hyderabad-spacious" border="0">
    <p>
      This image shows the most spacious and least spacious localities to live in Hyderabad. Spaciousness of a
      locality is calculated by
      taking the average of areas of houses in that locality. Most spacious localities are the localities that
      have the highest average area
      of all the houses in that locality and converse is true for the least spacious localities. From this image,
      we see that Gandi Maisamma, Tukaram Gate, and Hakimpet Hyderabad Karimnagar Highway are the least spacous
      localities in
      Hyderabad whereas
      Thumkunta, Salar Jung Colony and Mangalpally are the most spacious localities in Hyderabad

    <h3>Affordability</h3>
    <img class="LeftAlign" src="static/Affordability/HYDERABAD.png" alt="Aahemdabad-affordability" border="0">
    <p>
      This image shows the most afforable and least afforable localities to live in Hyderabad. Affordability
      of a locality is calculated by
      taking the average price of all the houses in that locality. Most affordable localities are the
      localities that have the lowest average
      price and the converse is true for least afforable localities. From this image, we see that
      Tukaram Gate, Bapu Bagh Colony Road, Zaheerabad
      are the most afforable localities in Hyderabad whereas Thumkunta, Punjagutta Market and Regimental Bazar are the least
      affordable localities in Hyderabad
