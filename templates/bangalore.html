        <p>
            In this image, we have analyzed 4 things, the distribution of rent in Bangalore, distribution of the area of
            houses in Bangalore,
            Number of bedrooms in the houses in Bangalore and distribution of bathrooms in the houses in Bangalore.
            From this figure, we find that the rent of most houses is under 50k rupees, most of the houses in Bangalore
            are under 2000 square
            feet in area, most houses in Bangalore have 1 or 2 bedrooms and 1 or 2 bathrooms

        <h3>Area</h3>
        <img class="RightAlign" src="static/Spacious/BANGALORE.png" alt="Bangalore-spacious" border="0">
        <p>
            This image shows the most spacious and least spacious localities to live in Bangalore. Spaciousness of a
            locality is calculated by
            taking the average of areas of houses in that locality. Most spacious localities are the localities that
            have the highest average area
            of all the houses in that locality and converse is true for the least spacious localities. From this image,
            we see that HSLR Layout 2nd Sector, Varthur Main Road and Hosa Road Junction are the least spacous localities in Bangalore whereas 
            Bellary Road Heebal Kempapura, Banashankari 6th Stage 6th Block and Nagenhalli are the most spacious localities in Bangalore

        <h3>Affordability</h3>
        <img class="LeftAlign" src="static/Affordability/BANGALORE.png" alt="Aahemdabad-affordability" border="0">
        <p>
            This image shows the most afforable and least afforable localities to live in Bangalore. Affordability
            of a locality is calculated by
            taking the average price of all the houses in that locality. Most affordable localities are the
            localities that have the lowest average
            price and the converse is true for least afforable localities. From this image, we see that
            Dasanapura, Kanakanagar, Chikkabidarakallu
            are the most afforable localities in Bangalore whereas 17th Main Road, Vittal Mallya Layout and Sector 6 HSR Layout are the least affordable
            localities in Bangalore
