            In this image, we have analyzed 4 things, the distribution of rent in Pune, distribution of the area of
            houses in Pune,
            Number of bedrooms in the houses in Pune and distribution of bathrooms in the houses in Pune.
            From this figure, we find that the rent of most houses is under 40k rupees, most of the houses in Pune
            are under 2000 square
            feet in area, most houses in Pune have 1 or 2 bedrooms and 1 or 2 bathrooms

        <h3>Area</h3>

        <p>
            This image shows the most spacious and least spacious localities to live in Pune. Spaciousness of a
            locality is calculated by
            taking the average of areas of houses in that locality. Most spacious localities are the localities that
            have the highest average area
            of all the houses in that locality and converse is true for the least spacious localities. From this image,
            we see that Dehu, Junnar and Karegaon are the least spacous localities in Pune whereas 
            Valvan Lonavala, Pangoli and Shedge Vasti Pimpri Chinchwad are the most spacious localities in Pune

        <h3>Affordability</h3>
        <img class="LeftAlign" src="static/Affordability/PUNE.png" alt="Aahemdabad-affordability" border="0">
        <p>
            This image shows the most afforable and least afforable localities to live in Pune. Affordability
            of a locality is calculated by
            taking the average price of all the houses in that locality. Most affordable localities are the
            localities that have the lowest average
            price and the converse is true for least afforable localities. From this image, we see that
            Talegaon Dhamdhere, Tukai Darshan and Junnar
            are the most afforable localities in Pune whereas Sindhi Colony, Paud, and Shedge Vasti Pimpri Chinchwad 
            are the least affordable localities in Pune
